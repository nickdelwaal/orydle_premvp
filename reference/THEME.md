# Summary

A high-contrast dark-mode design system with an editorial feel, using vibrant blue accents, sophisticated serif headings, and unique geometric cut-outs to create a premium, technical atmosphere.

# Style

The style blends "Digital Naturalism" with brutalist technicality. It uses a core palette of deep charcoal (`#0C0A09`), warm stone (`#E7E5E4`), and a signature blue accent (`#255bfc`). Typography is a dual-system: "Newsreader" for elegant, light-weight serif headings and "Instrument Sans" for functional UI and body text. Visuals are treated with a fixed 4% opacity noise overlay to provide texture and organic "analog" feel to the digital surfaces.

## Spec

### Colors

- Background: `#0C0A09` (Stone Black)
- Primary Accent: `#255bfc` (Electric Blue) - used for highlights, primary buttons, and critical status markers.
- Secondary Surface: `#1C1917` (Warm Charcoal) - used for section backgrounds and cards.
- Neutral Foreground: `#E7E5E4` (Off-white/Stone) - used for primary body text.
- Borders: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`

### Typography

- **Serif (Display)**: "Newsreader", serif. Weights: 200, 300, 400. Use for H1-H3. Use italics frequently for emphasis words within headers. Letter-spacing: `-0.02em`.
- **Sans (UI/Body)**: "Instrument Sans", sans-serif. Weights: 400, 500, 600. Use for body text, labels, and navigation. Size: 18px body, 14px labels.
- **Mono**: System monospace for technical identifiers (e.g., "Fig. 1A").

### Effects & Global Styles

- **Noise Overlay**: Fixed position SVG fractal noise, opacity `0.04`, `mix-blend-mode: overlay`.
- **Serrated Edges**: Section dividers using radial-gradient masks to create a jagged "postage-stamp" or "tear" effect (20px size).
- **Corner Radii**: 24px (Large) for primary cards, 9999px (Full) for buttons.
- **Transitions**: `300ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.

# Layout & Structure

A structured yet dynamic layout featuring a fixed glassmorphism navigation bar, asymmetrical hero sections, and a signature "bento-tab" layout for content sections.

## Navigation

Fixed top bar.
- Left: Logo with circular icon.
- Center: Pill-shaped navigation bar using `#E7E5E4/5` background with heavy `backdrop-blur` (8px).
- Links have a 300ms transition to `#E7E5E4` background with `#0C0A09` text.
- Right: Primary CTA button in `#255bfc` with rounded-full shape.

## Hero Section

Two-column grid (5:7 ratio).
- Left: H1 heading in Serif light weight, using Italics for the accent word.
- Sub-text in 60% opacity sans-serif.
- Social proof avatars with 70% opacity grayscale filter.
- Right: A large abstract image container with a "rounded-top-arch" (10rem radius) and rectangular bottom.
- Includes a "floating" sticky note badge in `#255bfc` rotated at 6 degrees.

## Tabbed Main Content

A container with "Folder" style navigation.
- Tabs are slightly rotated (-2 to -1 degrees) and overlap the main container.
- The active tab is larger and uses `#255bfc`.
- The content area below is `#1C1917` with a serrated top edge.
- Background features a 40px grid pattern at 3% opacity.

## Showcase Grid

- Cards with an aspect ratio of 3:4.
- Cards are `#292524` with images that have a `grayscale(100%)` filter, becoming full color on hover.
- Titles are in Serif Italic.
- One card in the grid should have a vertical offset (Y-axis translation) to break the grid's rigidity.

# Special Components

## Serrated Edge Divider

A procedural jagged edge used to divide dark sections.

Implementation:
- Use a `mask-image` with a radial-gradient: `radial-gradient(circle at 10px 0, transparent 0, transparent 5px, black 5px)`.
- Set `mask-size: 20px 10px` and `mask-repeat: repeat-x`.
- Apply to a 16px high div placed at the boundary of two sections.

## Sticky Note CTA

A highlight card that mimics a physical note pinned to the interface.

- Background: `#255bfc`
- Text: `#1C1917`
- Transform: `rotate(2deg)`
- Padding: 40px
- Border-radius: 24px
- On hover: `transform: rotate(0deg) scale(1.02)`
- Use Serif typography for the heading.
- Include a bottom `border-top` with low opacity for an interactive footer within the card.

## Catalog Label

Technical metadata label for images.

- Positioned absolute on images.
- Semi-transparent black background (40% opacity) with heavy backdrop-blur.
- Features a top row with "Fig. No" in 10px monospace and a status dot in `#255bfc`.

# Special Notes

- MUST use the noise overlay to prevent the dark colors from appearing flat.
- MUST NOT use standard pure black (`#000000`); use the stone-tinted `#0C0A09`.
- Headlines MUST use light weights (300 or lower) to maintain the "Avant-Garde" editorial aesthetic.
- Icons should be monochrome Lucide-style line icons.
